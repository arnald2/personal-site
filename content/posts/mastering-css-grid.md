CSS Grid has completely changed how I approach web layout. Gone are the days of float hacks and complex negative margins.

For this site, I used Grid extensively to handle the responsive behavior of the project cards and the timeline layout. The ability to simply define `grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr))` makes responsive design almost automatic.

### Quick Tip

Always name your grid lines if you're building a complex layout. It makes debugging (and reading your own code 6 months later) so much easier!
