When I set out to redesign this portfolio, I knew I wanted something that felt **distinctly engineering-focused** but still polished. The previous version was built on a heavy template that was hard to customize.

### The Goals

- Make it fast (vanilla JS/CSS).
- Showcase the *"Code"* aesthetic with monospaced fonts and terminal-like vibes.
- Ensure it's easy to update.

I decided to stick to a dark mode theme because let's be honest, that's where we spend most of our time as developers. The color palette revolves around a deep black/gray background with vibrant cyan accents to make interactive elements pop.

One of the coolest features is the dynamic timeline you see on the homepage. Getting those CSS calculations right for the responsive markers was a fun little challenge!
