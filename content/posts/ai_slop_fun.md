Ever since I discovered Dall-E and Midjourney, a couple of years ago, I got a bit obsessed with AI art. It's so fun to have a random idea, and bam, 2 minutes later you have a semi professional looking image of it. Granted it does not always match expectations, but it's still pretty fun, and sometimes the unexpected results are quite funny. One of my favorite new things to try is to use a picture I took or a sketch and have the AI augment the drawing to look like a real painting, or add some 
random monster into my landscape photos. I added some of the examples below. 

### Sketch to Painting to Video


#### 1. Ninja on Head
The evolution of a doodle.

#### 2. Alien Sketches
<div class="media-grid" style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(200px, 1fr)); gap: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">

#### 3. Weird Animals
Creating creatures that shouldn't exist.

#### 4. Painted Face
From rough sketch to realistic portrait.
<div class="media-grid" style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(150px, 1fr)); gap: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">

    <img src="assets/aislop/sketch_painted_face4.PNG" alt="Painted Face AI 3" loading="lazy">
</div>


#### 6. Circus Trainer
This is a super old sketch I had, originally I was thinking it could be some kind of circus trainer falling asleep, and an animal sneaking up on him. I never finished the background. However with AI I was able to add in more things to the scene, like the 
lighting in the background, the tiger. It's pretty impressive how well it was able to follow directions. I gave prompts "like move the tiger a bit back and into the shadow" and it was able to make it look exactly like I imagined. 
<div class="media-grid" style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(200px, 1fr)); gap: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">

    <img src="assets/aislop/circus_trainer3.png" alt="Circus Trainer 3" loading="lazy">
</div>

#### 7. Watch out Don Draper
This is an example of Veo doing something somewhat unexpected that I found hilarious. I just gave it a bunch of buzz words related to an Italian Beer, like vespa, leather pants etc, and it spit out this hilarious video.

### Augmenting vacation photos with AI?
Sure the black sand beaches of Tahiti are nice, but something was always missing. Now it is finally complete with Godzilla in the mix. 
<div class="media-grid" style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr)); gap: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">

### Music Slop

Another really fun AI app is Suno. I have been having tons of fun turning any random idea into a song. It's incredible how good the voices and music are. I don't think I could tell it's AI. It does sometimes mess up on the pronunciation of some words, but for the most part, it's amazing. I am scared to share the songs I have created since they are way too dumb. AI Slop Weird Al Yankovic over here. Now I finally have that country song about the consequences of eating too many onions I always wanted. 


#### 2. Whale Bone
I made this one from my frustrating experience of trying to get my daughter to participate at the soccer games. I used Claude for the lyrics, Suno lyrics are ok, but i found Claude to do a much better job.

#### 1. The Slop God
Another one I just made to wrap up this post. The AI Slop god. Which brings me to the final topic of the post below, is AI Art Art?

### Is AI Art actually Art? 

Many people have strong opinions about this. I don't really want to get into the formal definition of art, or skills needed to be an artist. I'll just say overall my experience with using AI to do anything creative is that it feels really fun for a bit, but then eventually I do start wondering "what was the point of that. Which I have never asked myself when drawing or a painting, no matter how bad the output was. I think it's the lack of effort that plays a big part into it. We value what we put effort into. If it's effortless, even if it's the most beautiful song or painting in the world it's a bit empty. So I think AI assisted artifacts can certainly be art in the hands of people who are very skilled, and are willing to put the effort to make something that raises above the baseline of "AI Slop" mediocrity. With the lowered barrier to entry we will probably get Software that would have never been built. Stories that would not have been told, and painting that would have never seen the light of day thanks to AI, which I think is kind of cool. Overall I am somewhat optimistic, although I still think it will always be more fun to do something by hand, and humans will always value effort and talent.
