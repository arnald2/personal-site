AI agents are rapidly evolving from simple chatbots to capable autonomous workers. We're seeing models that can plan, execute, and verify tasks—much like a human engineer would.

### Why this matters

It means we can offload the "boilerplate" thinking. Instead of spending hours setting up the scaffold for a project, an agent can do it in seconds. This shifts the engineer's role to more of an **Architecture & Review** position.

I believe the next few years will be defined by how well we can integrate these agents into our daily workflows without losing the human touch that makes great software truly *great*.
