Ever sinee i discovered Dall-E and Midjourney, a couple of years ago, i got a bit obsessed with AI art. It's so fun to have a random idea, and bam, 2 minutes later you have a semi profesional looking image of it. Granted it does not always match expectations, but it's still pretty fun, and sometimes the unexpected resultsa are quite funny. One of my favorite new things to try is to use a picture i took or a sketch and have the AI augment the drawing to look like a real painting, or add some 
random mosnster into my laandscape photos. I added some of the example below. 

### Skech to painting to Video



### Sure, your artsy black and white vacation pic is cool, but why not spice them up with a live dragon? 

### Don Drapper you better watch out, Slop Draper is coming for you.
