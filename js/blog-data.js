The previous version was built on a heavy template that was hard to customize.</p>\n<h3>The Goals</h3>\n<ul>\n    <li>Make it fast (vanilla JS/CSS).</li>\n    <li>Showcase the <em>\"Code\"</em> aesthetic with monospaced fonts and terminal-like vibes.</li>\n    <li>Ensure it's easy to update.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I decided to stick to a dark mode theme because let's be honest, that's where we spend most of our time as developers. The color palette revolves around a deep black/gray background with vibrant cyan accents to make interactive elements pop.</p>\n<p>One of the coolest features is the dynamic timeline you see on the homepage. Getting those CSS calculations right for the responsive markers was a fun little challenge!</p>\n",

We're seeing models that can plan, execute, and verify tasks—much like a human engineer would.</p>\n<h3>Why this matters</h3>\n<p>It means we can offload the \"boilerplate\" thinking. Instead of spending hours setting up the scaffold for a project, an agent can do it in seconds. This shifts the engineer's role to more of an <strong>Architecture & Review</strong> position.</p>\n<p>I believe the next few years will be defined by how well we can integrate these agents into our daily workflows without losing the human touch that makes great software truly <em>great</em>.</p>\n",

Gone are the days of float hacks and complex negative margins.</p>\n<p>For this site, I used Grid extensively to handle the responsive behavior of the project cards and the timeline layout. The ability to simply define <code>grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr))</code> makes responsive design almost automatic.</p>\n<h3>Quick Tip</h3>\n<p>Always name your grid lines if you're building a complex layout. It makes debugging (and reading your own code 6 months later) so much easier!</p>\n",
