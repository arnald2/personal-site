            "content": "<p>I have wanted a personal site for years. I used to have a simple one hosted on my university&#39;s server, but eventually I lost access to it, and they took the domain down at some point. I played around with some templates in the past, but never really took the time to actually host a site, and did not see the point. However, with the recent leaps in Agentic coding, it&#39;s become extremely easy to quickly put something together. With a single prompt, Claude Code was able to quickly generate a whole professional-looking site, and it gave me ideas on how to host it for free on GitHub; it even included detailed instructions. I am hoping to use this site as a place to put some HTML5 games, random blog posts, and side projects in the future. </p>\n<p>I then wanted to test the Antigravity IDE from Google. So I opened the repository in the IDE and continued adding the features I wanted for the site. I added a personal timeline, a blog tab, and various small improvements like URL linking to blog posts, and code refactoring. All while writing 0 lines of code myself. I have literally not looked at the JS or CSS files at all. It might be beautiful, or spaghetti code, I have no idea, but the site looks good enough, and behaves as expected, and that&#39;s all I care about for now. If anyone is reading this, and wants a similar site, feel free to fork (<a href=\"https://github.com/arnaldo/personal-site\">this repository</a>), and follow the step-by-step guide below, and just change the information to match your own. Can probably do it all much faster if you use Claude Code, and Antigravity IDE. Starting from scratch as I did is probably fun too, but it does take a bit more time. One frustration I had with Antigravity is that it hangs a lot, and I have to cancel the request and restart it. I had to do that pretty frequently. Also, since a lot of it is vanilla JS, it often fixes one thing and breaks something else. But it&#39;s pretty good at fixing anything that breaks with a follow-up prompt. </p>\n<p>One downside to GitHub hosting is that it&#39;s not ideal for adding media files. I might end up having to look \nfor an alternative to host the media files as the repo gets larger. </p>\n<h3>1. Hosting on GitHub Pages</h3>\n<p>Github supports free static hosting for public repositories. </p>\n<p><strong>Steps to Host:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Create a Repository</strong>: Go to GitHub and create a new public repository (e.g., <code>my-portfolio</code>).</li>\n<li><strong>Upload Code</strong>: Push your HTML, CSS, and JS files to this repository.</li>\n<li><strong>Enable Pages</strong>:<ul>\n<li>Go to your repository <strong>Settings</strong>.</li>\n<li>Click on <strong>Pages</strong> in the sidebar.</li>\n<li>Under <strong>Source</strong>, select <code>Deploy from a branch</code>.</li>\n<li>Choose your <code>main</code> branch and <code>/ (root)</code> folder.</li>\n<li>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>That&#39;s it! Your site will be online at <code>https://&lt;username&gt;.github.io/&lt;repository&gt;/</code>.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>2. Managing Your Content</h3>\n<p>One &quot;vibe coded&quot; extra feature I added is making the page easier to edit by separating the content from the code. And also separating the pages into individual files. This way, the resume, timeline, and blog posts can be updated without touching the code.</p>\n<h4>📅 Editing the Timeline</h4>\n<p>The vertical timeline in the &quot;About&quot; section is great for showing your career journey.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>File to Edit</strong>: <code>content/timeline.html</code></li>\n<li><strong>How</strong>: Open this file. You will see blocks like <code>&lt;div class=&quot;timeline-marker&quot;&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;div class=&quot;story-milestone&quot;&gt;</code>.</li>\n<li><strong>To Add a Milestone</strong>: Copy an existing block, change the year and the text description. The site automatically handles the scrolling animation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>📄 Updating the Resume</h4>\n<p>The Resume tab has nice styling to separate all the sections</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>File to Edit</strong>: <code>content/resume.html</code></li>\n<li><strong>How</strong>: This is standard HTML. Look for the <code>&lt;div class=&quot;card&quot;&gt;</code> elements under &quot;Work Experience&quot;.</li>\n<li><strong>Tip</strong>: Copy a whole <code>card</code> div to add a new job. Update the <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> texts for your skills.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>📮 Contact Info</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>File to Edit</strong>: <code>index.html</code> (Look for the <code>#contact</code> section).</li>\n<li><strong>How</strong>: Update the <code>href</code> links for your Email and LinkedIn.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>✍️ Adding a Blog Post</h4>\n<p>The blog uses Markdown, so it&#39;s easier to add new entries without dealing with HTML. I use <a href=\"https://obsidian.md/\">Obsidian</a> for note-taking already, so I am very used to markdown styling.\nSide note on Obsidian: Since it&#39;s just a text file on the file system, the directories can also be opened in Antigravity IDE, so you get the capabilities of having the AI agents explore notes for ideas, and update the written content etc. </p>\n<p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create a new file in <code>content/posts/</code> (e.g., <code>my-new-post.md</code>).</li>\n<li>Add this &quot;Frontmatter&quot; at the very top:<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">---\ntitle: My New Post\ndate: Jan 03, 2026\nreadTime: 5 min\ntags: [Life, Coding]\nexcerpt: &quot;A short summary of what this post is about.&quot;\n---\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>Write your content below it!</li>\n<li><strong>Important</strong>: Run the build script to update the site.<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">node scripts/build-content.js\n</code></pre>\n<em>(If you don&#39;t want to run code, you can ask an AI agent to &quot;Update the blog content&quot; for you!)</em></li>\n</ol>\n"

            "content": "<p>Ever since I discovered Dall-E and Midjourney a couple of years ago, I got a bit obsessed with AI art. It&#39;s so fun to have a random idea, and bam! 2 minutes later you have a semi-professional looking image of it. Granted it does not always match expectations, but it&#39;s still pretty fun, and sometimes the unexpected results are quite funny. One of my favorite new things to try is to use a picture I took or a sketch and have the AI augment the drawing to look like a real painting, or add some \nrandom monster into my landscape photos. I added some of the examples below. </p>\n<h3>Sketch to Painting to Video</h3>\n<h4>1. Ninja on Head</h4>\n<p>The evolution of a doodle.</p>\n<div class=\"media-grid\" style=\"display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(200px, 1fr)); gap: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;\">\n    <img src=\"assets/aislop/sketch_ninja_on_head.jpg\" alt=\"Ninja Sketch Original\" loading=\"lazy\">\n    <img src=\"assets/aislop/sketch_ninja_on_head2.PNG\" alt=\"Ninja Sketch AI Variation 1\" loading=\"lazy\">\n    <img src=\"assets/aislop/sketch_ninja_on_head3.png\" alt=\"Ninja Sketch AI Variation 2\" loading=\"lazy\">\n</div>\n<video controls style=\"max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: block; margin: 0 auto 2rem; border-radius: 8px;\">\n    <source src=\"assets/aislop/sketch_ninja_on_head_doodle_video.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n    Your browser does not support the video tag.\n</video>\n\n<h4>2. Alien Sketches</h4>\n<p>I don&#39;t know how I end up with these sketches, I just start doodling until it sort of looks like something, and then I make it look more like the something. </p>\n<div class=\"media-grid\" style=\"display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(200px, 1fr)); gap: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;\">\n    <img src=\"assets/aislop/sketch_aliens_1.jpg\" alt=\"Alien Sketch Original\" loading=\"lazy\">\n    <img src=\"assets/aislop/sketch_aliens_2.png\" alt=\"Alien Sketch AI 1\" loading=\"lazy\">\n    <img src=\"assets/aislop/sketch_aliens_3.png\" alt=\"Alien Sketch AI 2\" loading=\"lazy\">\n</div>\n\n<h4>3. Weird Animals</h4>\n<p>Creating creatures that shouldn&#39;t exist.</p>\n<div class=\"media-grid\" style=\"display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(200px, 1fr)); gap: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;\">\n    <img src=\"assets/aislop/sketch_weird_animals.jpg\" alt=\"Weird Animals Sketch\" loading=\"lazy\">\n    <img src=\"assets/aislop/sketch_weird_animals2.PNG\" alt=\"Weird Animals AI 1\" loading=\"lazy\">\n    <img src=\"assets/aislop/sketch_weird_animals3.png\" alt=\"Weird Animals AI 2\" loading=\"lazy\">\n</div>\n<video controls style=\"max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: block; margin: 0 auto 2rem; border-radius: 8px;\">\n    <source src=\"assets/aislop/sketch_weird_animal_video.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n    Your browser does not support the video tag.\n</video>\n\n<h4>4. Painted Face</h4>\n<p>From rough sketch to realistic portrait. One fun thing to try with AI is to keep asking it over and over again to improve the artifact it generated. It eventually converges to something, or just starts making it worse. But it&#39;s fun to try. I find with code for example it eventually just starts to make things really complicated, and overly abstract and constrained in its quest for &quot;better&quot;. <a href=\"https://minimaxir.com/2025/01/write-better-code/\">Cool Blog Post about this topic</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"media-grid\" style=\"display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(150px, 1fr)); gap: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;\">\n    <img src=\"assets/aislop/sketch_painted_face.jpg\" alt=\"Painted Face Sketch\" loading=\"lazy\">\n    <img src=\"assets/aislop/sketch_painted_face2.PNG\" alt=\"Painted Face AI 1\" loading=\"lazy\">\n    <img src=\"assets/aislop/sketch_painted_face3.PNG\" alt=\"Painted Face AI 2\" loading=\"lazy\">\n    <img src=\"assets/aislop/sketch_painted_face4.PNG\" alt=\"Painted Face AI 3\" loading=\"lazy\">\n</div>\n\n\n<h4>6. Circus Trainer</h4>\n<p>This is a super old sketch I had; originally, I was thinking it could be some kind of circus trainer falling asleep, and an animal sneaking up on him. I never finished the background. However with AI I was able to add in more things to the scene, like the \nlighting in the background, the tiger. It&#39;s pretty impressive how well it was able to follow directions. I gave prompts like &quot;Add a tiger to the background, and make it look like it&#39;s sneaking up on the trainer in the style of a Caravaggio painting&quot; and it was able to make it look exactly like I imagined. Or not quite exactly, I had to be like, move it a bit more back into the shadow... OK a bit more back... little more... alright, perfect. </p>\n<div class=\"media-grid\" style=\"display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(200px, 1fr)); gap: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;\">\n    <img src=\"assets/aislop/circus_trainer1.jpg\" alt=\"Circus Trainer 1\" loading=\"lazy\">\n    <img src=\"assets/aislop/circus_trainer2.png\" alt=\"Circus Trainer 2\" loading=\"lazy\">\n    <img src=\"assets/aislop/circus_trainer3.png\" alt=\"Circus Trainer 3\" loading=\"lazy\">\n</div>\n\n<h4>7. Watch out Don Draper</h4>\n<p>This is an example of Veo doing something somewhat unexpected that I found hilarious. I just gave it a bunch of buzz words related to an Italian Beer, like Vespa, leather pants, etc., and it spit out this hilarious video. \n<video controls style=\"max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: block; margin: 0 auto 2rem; border-radius: 8px;\">\n    <source src=\"assets/aislop/rejected_beer_ad.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n    Your browser does not support the video tag.\n</video></p>\n<h3>Augmenting vacation photos with AI?</h3>\n<p>Sure the black sand beaches of Tahiti are nice, but something was always missing. Now it is finally complete with Godzilla in the mix. Prompt was literally &quot;add Godzilla to this photo&quot;. </p>\n<div class=\"media-grid\" style=\"display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr)); gap: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;\">\n    <img src=\"assets/aislop/godzilla_original.JPG\" alt=\"Original Vacation Photo\" loading=\"lazy\">\n    <video controls style=\"max-width: 100%; border-radius: 8px;\">\n        <source src=\"assets/aislop/godzilla.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n        Your browser does not support the video tag.\n    </video>\n</div> \n\n\n<h3>Music Slop</h3>\n<p>Another really fun AI app is <a href=\"https://suno.com/\">Suno</a>. I have been having tons of fun turning any random idea into a song. It&#39;s incredible how good the voices and music are. I don&#39;t think I could tell it&#39;s AI. It does sometimes mess up on the pronunciation of some words, but for the most part, it&#39;s amazing. I am scared to share the songs I have created since they are way too dumb. AI Slop Weird Al Yankovic over here. Now I finally have that country song about the consequences of eating too many onions I always wanted. </p>\n<h4>2. Whale Bone</h4>\n<p>I made this one from my frustrating experience of trying to get my daughter to participate at the soccer games. I used Claude for the lyrics, Suno&#39;s lyrics are OK, but I found Claude to do a much better job. \n<video controls style=\"max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: block; margin: 0 auto 2rem; border-radius: 8px;\">\n    <source src=\"assets/aislop/whale_bone.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n    Your browser does not support the video tag.\n</video></p>\n<h4>1. The Slop God</h4>\n<p>Another one I just quickly made to wrap up this post. The Slop God. Lyrics from Anthropic, music by Suno, which brings me to the final topic of the post below, is AI Art Art? \n<video controls style=\"max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: block; margin: 0 auto 2rem; border-radius: 8px;\">\n    <source src=\"assets/aislop/the_slop_god.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n    Your browser does not support the video tag.\n</video> </p>\n<h3>Is AI Art actually Art?</h3>\n<p>Many people have strong opinions about this. I don&#39;t really want to get into the formal definition of art, or skills needed to be an artist. I&#39;ll just say overall my experience with using AI to do anything creative is that it feels really fun for a bit, but then eventually I do start wondering &quot;what was the point of all that&quot;. Which I have never asked myself when drawing or a painting, no matter how bad the output was. I think it&#39;s the lack of effort that plays a big part into it. We value what we put effort into. If it&#39;s effortless, even if it&#39;s the most beautiful song or painting in the world it&#39;s a bit empty. So I think AI assisted artifacts can certainly be art in the hands of people who are very skilled, and are willing to put the effort to make something that rises above the baseline of &quot;AI Slop&quot; mediocrity. With the lowered barrier to entry we will probably get Software that would have never been built. Stories that would not have been told, and paintings that would have never seen the light of day thanks to AI, which I think is kind of cool. I still think it will always be more fun to do something by hand, and humans will always value effort and talent. So to answer my own question, AI art can be art, but not all AI art is &quot;Art&quot;, I think some effort, intention and differentiation need to go into it. However, it&#39;s still fun for non-artists like me to play around with it and see what comes out. </p>\n"
