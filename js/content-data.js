            "content": "<p>When I set out to redesign this personal site, I didn&#39;t just want to build another portfolio—I wanted to experiment with a new way of coding. Instead of writing every line from scratch or wrestling with a heavy framework, I pair-programmed this entire project using <strong>Antigravity</strong> and <strong>Claude Code</strong>, two powerful AI coding agents.</p>\n<h3>The Goals</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Agentic Workflow</strong>: Let the AI handle the heavy lifting of boilerplate, refactoring, and CSS grid calculations.</li>\n<li><strong>Vanilla Performance</strong>: Stick to pure HTML, CSS, and JS. No heavy bundles.</li>\n<li><strong>Automated Deployment</strong>: Simple hosting via GitHub Pages.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Coding with AI Agents</h3>\n<p>This site was built by interacting with <strong>Antigravity</strong>, a Google Deepmind agent, and <strong>Claude Code</strong>. Here is how the workflow typically looked:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Refactoring at Speed</strong>: I asked the agent to &quot;modularize the massive <code>styles.css</code> file,&quot; and it intelligently split the code into <code>base.css</code>, <code>components.css</code>, <code>sections.css</code>, and <code>responsive.css</code>, updating the HTML links automatically.</li>\n<li><strong>Live Coding</strong>: I could say &quot;Make the timeline marker active when I scroll,&quot; and the agent wrote the Intersection Observer logic in <code>js/timeline.js</code> instantly.</li>\n<li><strong>Content Management</strong>: We built a custom Node.js script to compile these Markdown files into a JSON object, so I can write blogs in Markdown without needing a database.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It wasn&#39;t just auto-complete; it was <em>auto-complete for entire features</em>.</p>\n<h3>Tech Stack</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Core</strong>: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+).</li>\n<li><strong>Styling</strong>: Custom CSS Variables and Grid layouts.</li>\n<li><strong>Build System</strong>: A zero-dependency Node.js script that compiles content.</li>\n<li><strong>Hosting</strong>: GitHub Pages.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>How to Host This on GitHub Pages</h3>\n<p>One of the best parts of this stack is how easy it is to deploy. Since it&#39;s a static site, you don&#39;t need Vercel or Netlify (though those work too).</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Push your code</strong> to a public GitHub repository.</li>\n<li>Go to your repository <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Pages</strong>.</li>\n<li>Under <strong>Source</strong>, select <code>Deploy from a branch</code>.</li>\n<li>Choose your <code>main</code> branch and the <code>/ (root)</code> folder.</li>\n<li>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Your site will be live at <code>https://&lt;username&gt;.github.io/&lt;repo-name&gt;/</code>.</p>\n<h3>Developing Locally</h3>\n<p>If you want to try this &quot;AI-native&quot; development flow yourself:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Clone the repo</strong>: <code>git clone &lt;your-repo-url&gt;</code></li>\n<li><strong>Run the build script</strong>: Whenever you add a new post (like this one), just run:<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">node scripts/build-content.js\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Open in Browser</strong>: No dev server required, just open <code>index.html</code>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This project is proof that with the right AI tools, you can build high-quality, custom software faster than ever before.</p>\n"

We&#39;re seeing models that can plan, execute, and verify tasks—much like a human engineer would.</p>\n<h3>Why this matters</h3>\n<p>It means we can offload the &quot;boilerplate&quot; thinking. Instead of spending hours setting up the scaffold for a project, an agent can do it in seconds. This shifts the engineer&#39;s role to more of an <strong>Architecture &amp; Review</strong> position.</p>\n<p>I believe the next few years will be defined by how well we can integrate these agents into our daily workflows without losing the human touch that makes great software truly <em>great</em>.</p>\n"

The ability to simply define <code>grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr))</code> makes responsive design almost automatic.</p>\n<h3>Quick Tip</h3>\n<p>Always name your grid lines if you&#39;re building a complex layout. It makes debugging (and reading your own code 6 months later) so much easier!</p>\n"
